# Text_summerizer_NLP

##Text summerizer using TextRank(graph-based ranking algorithm for natural language) & cosine similarity.

## im constantly adding new code to increase the efficiency of creating summaries

steps that are followed to create summary:

-read the text - Do preprocessing on text
-convert into chunks 
-do sentence similarity
-make vectors - do cosine similarity
-create similarity matrix
-using pagerank of networkx - a summary is created based on the number of lines passed that our summarizer would summarize to.
